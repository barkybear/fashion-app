## De Bijenkorf Frontend Developer Task

It is built using [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/). It was created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Development Setup

###### Prerequisites:

- node.js: 8.2.0
- npm: 5.3.0

###### Running the UI locally:

1. Ensure you have the node.js & npm versions listed above installed. You can install these using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

2. Clone the repo: `git clone git@bitbucket.org:barkybear/fashion-app.git`

3. Run `cd fashion-app` & `npm install`.

4. To run the local dev server, `npm start` and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in the browser.


###### Thoughts on the Assignment:

- I don't have Sketch, so I worked as best I could from the `jpg` image files.
- Initially, I tried to use CSS & Flexbox to get the 2 background images (`man.png` & `woman.png`) in the first section overlapping and aligned. I was having trouble getting all the different smaller device dimensions/media queries to look reasonable, so I copped out and edited the 2 images into a single image for ease of use.
- It's responsive.
- I know that CSS isn't my strongest skill, but I am eager to learn more.
- I used React & ES6 since this is my main skillset in frontend development.
